# Bike-Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes bike-sharing data to answer two key questions:

1. What season has the highest bike-sharing rides?
2. What time of day is the peak of bicycle borrowing?

## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:

- **dteday**: The date of the bike-sharing record.
- **season**: The season during which the rides occurred (1: Winter, 2: Spring, 3: Summer, 4: Fall).
- **hr**: The hour of the day when the rides were taken (0-23).
- **cnt**: The total number of bike rides for that hour.

## Analysis

### 1. What season has the highest bike-sharing rides?

Upon analyzing the bike-sharing data, it was found that **[insert your findings, e.g., "Summer had the highest number of bike-sharing rides, followed by Spring, Fall, and Winter."]** This could be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the summer months, encouraging more people to use bike-sharing services.

### 2. What time of day is the peak of bicycle borrowing?

The analysis revealed that **[insert your findings, e.g., "the peak borrowing times were observed between 5 PM and 7 PM, which coincides with the end of the workday when many individuals commute home."]** This indicates that bike-sharing services are most utilized during these hours, reflecting commuter patterns.

## Conclusion

The analysis of bike-sharing data highlights seasonal and temporal trends in bike usage. These insights can inform bike-sharing companies and city planners to optimize services, ensuring availability during peak seasons and hours.

## Future Work

Further analysis can be conducted to understand factors influencing bike usage, such as weather conditions, holidays, or special events. Incorporating additional data sources may enhance the depth of the analysis.
